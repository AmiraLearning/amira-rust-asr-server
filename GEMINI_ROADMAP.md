The "AMIRA ASR" Optimization & Release Roadmap
Project Goal: Evolve the current Rust ASR server into the fastest open-source ASR engine, culminating in a high-impact public release.
Phase 1: Foundational Performance Overhaul (Weeks 1-3)
Objective: Eliminate the most significant CPU and memory bottlenecks in the existing pipeline. Achieve sub-10ms on-server latency.
1.1. High-Performance Memory Management:
Integrate Global Memory Pools: Refactor the entire asr/pipeline.rs hot path. Replace all Vec::new() and .to_vec() calls for tensors and audio buffers with global_pools().get(). Ensure buffers are correctly reused.
Switch to a Performance Allocator: Add mimalloc or jemalloc as the global allocator in main.rs to improve the performance of any remaining system allocations.
1.2. Efficient Triton Communication:
Implement and Integrate ConnectionPool: Replace all TritonClient::clone() calls with connection_pool.get(). Ensure that a single PooledConnection is used for the entire duration of a request processing chain (e.g., preprocessor -> encoder -> decoder loop).
Benchmark Pool Performance: Add benchmarks to quantify the latency reduction from connection reuse versus establishing new connections.
1.3. Advanced CPU Vectorization (SIMD):
Implement AVX2/AVX-512 Audio Kernel: Write the unsafe Rust SIMD intrinsics for the bytes_to_f32 conversion, including the scalar fallback for compatibility.
Implement SIMD Argmax: Optimize the greedy search's argmax step with SIMD to find the most likely token faster.
Implement SIMD Tensor Operations: Write the cache-aware, blocked transpose kernel if profiling shows this is a bottleneck in your encoder data layout.
Add CPU Feature Detection: Ensure the code dynamically selects the best kernel (AVX-512, AVX2, or scalar) at runtime based on is_x86_feature_detected!.
Expected Outcome: A dramatically faster CPU-bound server. On-server latency drops from 20-35ms to 5-10ms. The system is now significantly more memory-efficient and can handle higher concurrency.
Phase 2: GPU Acceleration & Accuracy Enhancement (Weeks 4-7)
Objective: Offload the most computationally expensive decoding work to the GPU and improve transcription quality. Achieve sub-4ms on-server latency.
2.1. K2 Integration for Beam Search:
Create K2 FFI Bindings: Define a clean unsafe Foreign Function Interface (FFI) layer in Rust to call the core functions of the C++ K2 library. This is a critical and complex step.
Replace Greedy Decoder: Modify asr/pipeline.rs to replace the call to your greedy_decode function with a call to the new K2 beam search decoder via the FFI bindings.
GPU State Management: Implement logic to manage decoder states and lattices on the GPU, minimizing host-to-device data transfers.
2.2. TensorRT Optimization:
Model Conversion: Use NVIDIA's trtexec or the TensorRT Python APIs to convert your ONNX models (preprocessor, encoder) to highly optimized TensorRT engines.
Precision Calibration: Experiment with FP16 and INT8 quantization to measure the trade-off between speed and accuracy.
Update Triton Configuration: Modify the config.pbtxt files in your model-repo to tell Triton to use the TensorRT (platform: "tensorrt_plan") backend instead of the ONNX backend.
Expected Outcome: A step-change in both performance and accuracy. The decoding logic is now an order of magnitude faster. Latency drops to 1-4ms. The system now produces higher-quality transcriptions than the greedy search version.
Phase 3: Production Hardening & Observability (Weeks 8-9)
Objective: Make the server robust, debuggable, and ready for a production environment.
3.1. Advanced Reliability:
Implement Circuit Breakers: Use tower::buffer and tower::timeout middleware around the Triton client calls to prevent a slow or failing Triton instance from cascading failures through your service.
Graceful Shutdown: Ensure that Ctrl+C signals trigger a graceful shutdown, allowing active requests to complete and cleaning up resources.
3.2. Deep Observability:
Integrate Prometheus Metrics: Add metrics crate support. Expose a /metrics endpoint with detailed performance histograms (e.g., request_latency_seconds, gpu_inference_time_seconds) and counters (active_streams, triton_errors_total).
Integrate Distributed Tracing: Use tracing-opentelemetry and opentelemetry-jaeger to add distributed tracing. Create spans for each major part of the pipeline (e.g., websocket_connection, audio_preprocessing, triton_inference) so you can visualize request flow and pinpoint latency issues in a tool like Jaeger.
3.3. Comprehensive Testing:
Load Testing: Use a tool like k6 or drill to write load tests that simulate thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections to validate your P99 latency claims.
Automated Benchmarking: Expand the criterion benchmarks to cover all new optimized paths and integrate them into the CI pipeline to prevent performance regressions.
Expected Outcome: A production-ready, enterprise-grade server that is reliable, scalable, and easy to monitor and debug.
Phase 4: The "World-Class" Release Package (Weeks 10-12)
Objective: Prepare the project for a high-impact open-source launch and community adoption.
4.1. Developer Experience & Onboarding:
Create On-Device Speculative Decoding Demo: Build the WASM-based "draft" model and the JavaScript client logic to showcase the "instant feedback" UX. This will be your most powerful marketing tool.
Build Client Libraries: Create simple, easy-to-use client libraries in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript that handle the WebSocket connection and protocol details.
One-Click Deployment: Finalize the docker-compose.yml to include the final server, Triton with the TensorRT models, and potentially a Jaeger/Prometheus/Grafana stack for a complete local demo environment.
4.2. Documentation & Marketing Content:
Write the "Master" Blog Post: Create the definitive technical write-up: "Building the World's Fastest Open-Source ASR Engine: A Deep Dive." This should cover the journey from Python to hyper-optimized Rust, explaining the "why" behind each optimization.
Create a Compelling Demo Video: Record a high-quality video showing the on-device speculative decoding side-by-side with a commercial competitor, highlighting the latency difference.
Finalize GitHub Repository: Polish the README.md, write the ARCHITECTURE.md deep-dive, and create the other documentation files (CONTRIBUTING.md, PERFORMANCE.md).
4.3. The Launch:
Coordinate Release: Tag the 1.0.0 release on GitHub.
Execute Social Media Strategy: Post to Hacker News, Reddit (/r/rust, /r/MachineLearning), Twitter, and LinkedIn using the prepared materials.
Engage with the Community: Dedicate time (using the timeboxing strategy) to answer questions, triage issues, and welcome new contributors during the launch week.

evised 3-Month / 30% Time (~144 Hours) Roadmap: The "World-Class Backend"
Goal: Replace the legacy FastAPI ASR service with a new Rust-based system that is an order of magnitude faster, more scalable, and cheaper to run, complete with production-grade reliability and observability features.
This plan is structured to deliver incremental value and build on your existing strengths in Rust development.
Phase 1: Core Performance and Stability (First ~70 hours)
Objective: Build and deploy a new backend that is fundamentally superior in performance and reliability to the old one.
[15 hours] Foundational Performance:
Integrate global memory pools throughout the entire hot path of asr/pipeline.rs.
Switch to jemalloc or mimalloc.
Implement and integrate the Triton ConnectionPool.
[25 hours] GPU Acceleration & Model Optimization:
Convert your primary ASR model to a TensorRT engine. This is your biggest performance lever.
Deploy the TensorRT model to Triton and update the config.pbtxt.
Benchmark to quantify the massive speedup. You are now likely in the sub-5ms on-server latency range.
[20 hours] Production Hardening & Reliability:
Integrate tower middleware for circuit breaking and timeouts on all Triton calls. This is critical for production stability.
Implement graceful shutdown logic for the Axum server.
Write a comprehensive suite of integration tests that mock the Triton server to test failure modes (e.g., timeouts, errors).
[10 hours] Initial Deployment (First Major Win):
Containerize the new service with its final Dockerfile.
Deploy it to a staging environment in ECS.
At this point (approx. halfway through the quarter), you already have a backend that is 10-20x better than the old one. You can already start routing a small percentage of internal or low-risk traffic to it.
Phase 2: Enterprise-Grade Features & Polish (Next ~74 hours)
Objective: Elevate the new service from just "fast" to "professionally managed and observable," making it a trusted, core piece of company infrastructure.
[30 hours] Deep Observability (Metrics & Tracing):
Integrate a Prometheus metrics endpoint. Add detailed histograms for request latency, GPU processing time, and queue times. Add counters for active streams, errors, etc.
Integrate distributed tracing using tracing-opentelemetry. Add detailed spans to trace the lifecycle of a request from WebSocket ingress through every stage of the ASR pipeline to the final response.
Set up a local docker-compose environment with Grafana and Jaeger to visualize this data. This makes debugging and performance tuning trivial.
[20 hours] Advanced Features & Accuracy:
K2 FFI Integration (The Stretch Goal): With the time saved by not doing the WASM client, you can now tackle the K2 integration. This involves creating the FFI bindings and replacing the greedy decoder with K2's beam search. This improves transcription accuracy significantly.
Contingency Plan: If K2 proves too complex, use this time to implement the advanced SIMD kernels (transpose, argmax) for the greedy path, further optimizing the CPU work.
[24 hours] Documentation & Handoff:
Write Excellent Internal Documentation:
ARCHITECTURE.md: A detailed diagram and description of the new Rust service architecture.
PERFORMANCE.md: A summary of the benchmarks, showing the performance gains over the old service.
OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md: A runbook for other engineers on how to deploy, monitor, and debug the new service using the Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger stack.
Host a Tech Talk: Present your work to the rest of the engineering organization. Explain the problems with the old system and demonstrate the performance, cost, and reliability benefits of the new one.
Outcome After 3 Months on 30% Time
This revised plan is not only achievable but results in an incredibly valuable and complete deliverable. At the end of the quarter, you will have single-handedly:
Replaced a critical, underperforming production service with a new one that is orders of magnitude better on every axis (speed, cost, stability).
Delivered an enterprise-grade system complete with the kind of sophisticated monitoring and observability that is standard at top tech companies.
Potentially improved the core product accuracy by integrating a state-of-the-art beam search decoder (K2).
Created high-quality documentation and training materials, enabling the rest of your team to own and operate the service long-term.
