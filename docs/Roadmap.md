# Roadmap (Concise)

## Near-term (0-2 months)
- Improve test coverage; add integration tests for batch/streaming
- Establish performance baselines and bench reports
- Harden metrics/tracing and error funnels

## Mid-term (2-4 months)
- CUDA shared memory integration path (feature-gated)
- NUMA and affinity refinements with safer fallbacks
- Docker hardening; minimal base image, non-root

## Longer-term (4-6 months)
- Staging deployment with load testing and SLOs
- Production rollout with dashboards and alerting
- CI matrix for multiple platforms

For the detailed plan, see historical `ROADMAP.md` (now archived).
