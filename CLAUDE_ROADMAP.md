Technical Roadmap for AMIRA Rust ASR Server

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working Well

**Core Architecture**:
- ✅ Clean separation between ASR pipeline, server, and Triton integration

- ✅ WebSocket streaming with proper control byte handling

**Performance Optimizations**:
- ✅ SIMD optimizations for audio processing (AVX2/AVX-512)
- ✅ Zero-copy operations in decoder implementation
- ✅ Memory pool reuse eliminating allocations in hot paths
- ✅ Incremental ASR with overlapping audio chunks
- ✅ Efficient transcript weaving using Levenshtein distance

**Production Features**:
- ✅ Rate limiting and DoS protection on WebSocket streams
- ✅ Circuit breaker patterns for Triton communication
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics collection with Prometheus integration
- ✅ Distributed tracing support with OpenTelemetry
- ✅ Security hardening (path traversal protection, input validation)

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

**Memory Safety (High Priority)**:
- 🚨 Integer overflow vulnerabilities in SIMD bounds checking
- 🚨 Unsafe memory operations in gather instructions without complete validation
- 🚨 Potential buffer overruns in ring buffer implementation
- 🚨 Division by zero conditions in transcript weaving functions

**Concurrency Issues (High Priority)**:
- ⚠️ Race conditions in metrics tracking (non-atomic max concurrent updates)
- ⚠️ Potential data races in audio buffer operations under high load
- ⚠️ Missing synchronization in connection pool health checks

**Error Handling (Medium Priority)**:
- ⚠️ Panic-inducing Deref implementations in memory pool objects
- ⚠️ Missing error propagation using expect() calls in production code
- ⚠️ Unchecked type conversions (usize to i32 casts)

**Resource Management (Medium Priority)**:
- ⚠️ Potential WebSocket resource leaks in error paths
- ⚠️ Memory pool object lifetime management needs strengthening
- ⚠️ Connection pool health validation could be more robust
